    title: "Haseeb - Founder & CEO"
    excerpt: 'Haseeb graduated from the University of Waterloo with a degree in Mechatronics Engineering and is the founder behind Zenith. After experiencing firsthand the difficulties around waking up in the morning and trying to go to sleep at night, he resolved to develop a highly intelligent AI powered sleep device, an all-in-one solution that could solve all the issues surrounding sleep. Haseeb has honed his electro-mechanical expertise at organizations like Teledyne FLIR, where he worked on drones, and Dana, where he developed highly efficient electric valves with potential patents pending. Beyond driving Zenithâ€™s mission, Haseeb stays active by playing soccer and working out, maintaining the energy and focus needed to revolutionize the sleep industry.'
