    title: "Haseeb - Founder & CEO - Mechanical Lead"
    excerpt: 'Haseeb is in his final year of Mechatronics Engineering at the University of Waterloo and the visionary founder behind Zenith. After experiencing firsthand how the wake-up process can be the worst part of the day for many people, he resolved to develop the world’s most advanced alarm clock to finally fix that problem once and for all. Haseeb has honed his mechanical engineering expertise at organizations like Teledyne FLIR, where he worked on drones, and Dana, where he developed highly efficient electric valves with potential patents pending. Beyond driving Zenith’s mission, Haseeb stays active by playing soccer and working out, maintaining the energy and focus needed to revolutionize the way people start their day.'

    title: "Umar - Software Lead"
    excerpt: "Umar graduated from the University of Waterloo with a degree in Computer Engineering in 2024. Despite working full time as a full stack engineer, waking up in the morning is still the part of his day. Checking slack isn't as dreadful as getting out of bed. No one wants to be face dread first thing in the morning, so that's where Zenith Alarm comes in. He has technical background across software, including embedded, android applications, React web applications and FastAPI backend systems. Umar also likes playing tennis, staying active, travelling, and occasionally making YouTube videos... but before he can do the things he loves, he has to get out of his bed with energy."
